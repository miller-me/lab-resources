#### To use the run_cellpose.ipynb Notebook on the Workstation:

1. Open Anaconda Navigator

2. Launch CMD.exe Prompt in Anaconda Navigator

3. In the Command Prompt window, run these commands in order (hitting Enter after each one):

	 `cd \`
	 `D:`
	 `conda activate cellpose`   
	 `jupyter notebook`

Jupyter should open in a new Chrome window automatically. You should see a file browser listing folders from the "D:" drive.

	- If this is NOT the case, click "Quit" in the top right corner, close the window, then follow the above steps again.
	- Once Jupyter is open, you must leave Jupyter AND Command Prompt windows open during the run !!!

In the Jupyter window, navigate to the "Jupyter_Notebooks" folder in "Monaghan Lab" -> "Melissa".
Open the run_cellpose.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions there. 

Alternatively, you can download the Notebook from GitHub to your user folder.

**If you are changing the segmentation parameters**, please duplicate the notebook and edit the duplicate.
