    "\n",
    "##### Defining cellpose model #####\n",
    "\n",
    "`model_type='cyto'` for cells; `model_type='nuclei'` for nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "`gpu=True` to use GPU, `gpu=False` to not use GPU. GPU use is suggested by cellpose to speed up segmentation. It won't affect output. If it gives you an error just turn it off but it will slow things down considerably. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Segmentation loop #####\n",
    "\n",
    "`img` is the earlier defined input image. Don't change.\n",
    "\n",
    "`diameter=None` will estimate cell sizes on an image-by-image basis. Change to an integer (in pixels) to use the same diameter for each image. If diameter is too large, cells may be over-merged. If diameter is too small, cells may be split. \n",
    "\n",
    "`channels=[a,b]` are the channels used. Edit this in `io.masks_flows_to_seg` too.\n",
    "- The first element `a` is the channel to segment. The second element `b` is an optional nuclear channel. \n",
    "- `a`: `0` = grayscale, `1` = red, `2` = green, `3` = blue.\n",
    "- `b`: `0` = none, otherwise same options as `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`resample=True` \"runs dynamics at original image size\". Change to `resample=False` for faster but less accurate boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "`min_size` sets the minimum number of pixels per mask. Default is `15`, turn off using `min_size=-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`flow_threshold` sets a threshold of error allowed between flows and masks. The default value is `0.4`. Increase if there are too few masks, but decrease if your masks are poorly shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "`mask_threshold` will discard masks below a certain probability. Default is `mask_threshold=0.0` to keep all masks, while `mask_threshold=1.0` will discard all. Too high, and there may not be as many areas covered as expected. Too low, and there will be too many masks from \"dim\" areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In 3D\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two main options for dealing with 3D images in cellpose: one which segments your 2D slices and stitches them together, and the other which runs segmentation volumetrically.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `do_3D=False`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this if volumetric segmentation is not working well.\n",
    "\n",
    "`stitch_threshold`: 2D XY masks will stich across Z axis if the mask between the current and next slices are at or above the threshold value. This might take some trial-and-error to get quality stitching.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `do_3D=True`\n",
    "\n",
    "`flow_threshold` is ignored in 3D. Use `min_size` instead to filter false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "`diameter=None` is ignored in 3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "`anisotropy` accounts for sampling differences between XY and Z axes. For example, set to `2.0` if Z is sampled half as densely as XY.\n",
    "\n",
    "`channel_axis` sets the image axis corresponding to the channels. If `channel_axis=None`, cellpose will automatically try to determine it.\n",
    "\n",
    "`z_axis` sets the image axis corresponding to Z. If `z_axis=None`, cellpose will automatically try to determine which axis is Z."
